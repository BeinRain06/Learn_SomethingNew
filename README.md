# COLMAR ACADEMY

# # An University for your future

> This is my design of the first page of the Colmar Academy Website

Basically the prototype has four main sections :
1. Learn something new
2. Keep practicing
3. Start with a skill
4. Thesis exibit 

The ** section 1 ** ' Learn something new ' is our showcase 

The ** section 2 ** ' Keep practicing ' spotlight our community and our social environment 

the ** part 3 **  ' Start with a skill ' is all about differents topics our school provide for learn.

> Learn a future skills for enhancements of your knowledge and become flexible

The ** last main part ** ' Thesis exibit' sit with a video showing our journey through the learn. Displaying with the change of weagter these overall day to success . Starting at the sunrise to the dark depth night.
